    "content": "[Game Background]\nOn a distant interstellar route, the Goose clan is building a giant spaceship to carry their new home. To prevent infiltration and sabotage, the ship uses the「Traffic Light Protocol」: Green light for free movement and communication, Yellow light for mandatory distribution to work stations, Red light for full ship lockdown—all engineers must complete tasks in place.\nBut imposters have infiltrated: the Duck clan. They look identical to Geese but aim to eliminate Geese and sabotage the project. Worse, the ship's life support system uses dynamic「Life Codes」: each member has a dynamic oxygen verification code, which can be shared for oxygen replenishment during collaboration; but Ducks only need to peek and enter the life code during lockdown to instantly disconnect the other's life support system, creating a silent「accident」.\nWhen the alarm sounds, crew members can only convene an emergency meeting and vote suspects into space. Engineering progress, oxygen levels, teammates' eyes, and phone screen reflections will all be evidence for judging the truth—on this unfinished interstellar ark, survival and completion must happen simultaneously.\n\n[Victory Conditions]\n• Goose: 100% task progress or vote out all Ducks.\n• Duck: Kill all Geese, or Duck count ≥ Non-Duck count.\n• Dodo (Neutral): Win by being voted out.\n• Hawk (Neutral): Can kill anyone, survive to the end (only you or you + 1 Goose left).\n• Woodpecker (Neutral): Can cause a target player’s oxygen to leak, survive to the end (only you or you + 1 Goose left).\n\n[Round Rhythm]\n• 90 seconds per round: Green 15s location selection → Yellow 15s movement → Red 60s tasks/kills.\n• Life codes refresh randomly once per round, with a 5-second countdown warning before refresh.\n\n[Life Code & Oxygen]\n• Red light shows 2-digit life code for kills/replenishing oxygen.\n• After entering life code, both kill and replenish actions have a 10s cooldown.\n• Oxygen Replenishment: +90s each time; once per player per round.\n• Initial oxygen 270s per person, death on depletion; Ducks and Hawks automatically use 180s backup oxygen when hitting zero (once per game).\n• Geese attempting to kill results in foul death.\n• Invalid life code input during kill attempts results in 30s oxygen penalty.\n\n[Meeting & Voting]\n• Take turns speaking (suggested 30-60s per person, Host can skip or extend discussion time).\n• Simultaneous anonymous voting (Host can extend voting time, ends when all vote).\n• Can self-vote or abstain; vote counts for each player are public.\n\n[Task Mechanics]\n• Personal Task: Success +2% progress, failure adds nothing; costs 10s oxygen each time.\n• Shared Task: Starts when all players at location tap; success adds +3% progress per person; failure adds no progress but deducts oxygen.\n• Types: Nine-Grid Treasure Hunt, Digit Puzzle, Rotation Match (10s limit).\n\n[Emergency Tasks]\n• Oxygen Leak: Oxygen drain becomes -3/sec; fixed if any player gives you oxygen; no extra oxygen cost.\n• Golden Rabbit: Join hunt team within 8s; nine-grid capture, success if anyone selects it; reward +8% progress.\n\n[Location Effects] (Active when alone)\n1. Kitchen (Oxygen Supply): Self oxygen +90s.\n2. Medical Bay (Remote Healing): Give any other player +90s oxygen.\n3. Power Room (Power Boost): +3% personal task progress this round.\n4. Monitor Room (View Footage): Peek at a random different-faction player's life code at specified location (shows for 5s).\n5. Warehouse (Emergency O₂): +60s oxygen for all players.\n6. Dispatch Room (Random Dispatch): Next yellow light redistributes all players (ignores green light selection), only you go to your chosen location.\n7. Stasis Pod (Absolute Dormancy): Enter dormancy, no tasks, no oxygen cost, immune to all effects (cannot be killed/monitored/replenished/drained/haunted).\n\n[Special Roles]\n🦢 Goose Faction\n- Vigilante Goose: Has only one kill chance, can kill any player.\n- Sheriff Goose: Can kill any player, but dies immediately if killing a Goose.\n- Coroner Goose: When alone, can investigate a corpse's cause of death (Kill / Poison / Suffocation / Suicide / Foul Death).\n- Foreman Goose: When alone, can investigate a player's task contribution.\n🦆 Duck Faction\n- Poisoner Duck: When killing, poisons the target; after 60s, if target is still alive, they die from poison.\n- Saboteur Duck: When doing tasks, buries hidden hazards equal to 2x the contribution; when total progress reaches 100%, hazards explode, reducing progress by corresponding %. After explosion, system patches vulnerabilities and Saboteur Duck loses this ability.\n🐦 Neutral Faction\n- Dodo: Your goal is to get voted out in meetings to win alone.\n- Hawk: You can kill any player. Survive to the end (only you or you + 1 Goose left) to win.\n- Woodpecker: Your kill doesn't kill the target, but causes their oxygen to leak (same as emergency task effect). Survive to the end (only you or you + 1 Goose left) to win.\n\n[Ghost Haunting]\nWhen a player dies and their body is found triggering a meeting, they enter「Ghost」state. Ghosts don't physically move but act via App from the rest area.\n- 🟢 Green Light: Select a location (or choose「Skip/Don't Haunt」).\n- 🟡 Yellow Light: Ghost appears at selected location; if skipped, appears nowhere.\n- 🔴 Red Light: Ghost sees live players and other ghosts at location, and can choose 1 live player to [Haunt].\n  - Effect: Target loses extra 3s oxygen every 10s, starts immediately.\n  - Stacking: Multiple ghosts can haunt the same target; cap is 9s extra drain per 10s (max 3 ghosts)."
