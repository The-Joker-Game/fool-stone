        "content": "[Game Background]\nOn a distant interstellar route, the Goose clan is building a giant spaceship to carry their new home. To prevent infiltration and sabotage, the ship uses the \"Traffic Light Protocol\": Green light for free movement and communication, Yellow light for mandatory distribution to work stations, Red light for full ship lockdown—all engineers must complete tasks in place.\nBut imposters have infiltrated: the Duck clan. They look identical to Geese but aim to eliminate Geese and sabotage the project. Worse, the ship's life support system uses dynamic \"Life Codes\": each member has a dynamic oxygen verification code, which can be shared for oxygen replenishment during collaboration; but Ducks only need to peek and enter the life code during lockdown to instantly disconnect the other's life support system, creating a silent \"accident\".\nWhen the alarm sounds, crew members can only convene an emergency meeting and vote suspects into space. Engineering progress, oxygen levels, teammates' eyes, and phone screen reflections will all be evidence for judging the truth—on this unfinished interstellar ark, survival and completion must happen simultaneously.\n\n[Victory Conditions]\n• Goose: 100% task progress or vote out all Ducks.\n• Duck: Kill all Geese, or Duck count ≥ Non-Duck count.\n• Dodo (Neutral): Win by being voted out.\n• Hawk (Neutral): Can kill anyone, survive to the end (only you or you + 1 Goose left).\n\n[Round Rhythm]\n• 90 seconds per round: Green 15s location selection → Yellow 15s movement → Red 60s tasks/kills.\n• Life codes refresh randomly once per round, with a 5-second countdown warning before refresh.\n\n[Life Code & Oxygen]\n• Red light shows 2-digit life code for kills/replenishing oxygen.\n• After entering life code, both kill and replenish actions have a 10s cooldown.\n• Oxygen Replenishment: +90s each time; once per player per round.\n• Initial oxygen 270s per person, death on depletion; Ducks and Hawks automatically use 180s backup oxygen when hitting zero (once per game).\n• Geese attempting to kill results in foul death.\n• Invalid life code input during kill attempts results in 30s oxygen penalty.\n\n[Meeting & Voting]\n• 60s discussion (Host can skip or extend 30s).\n• 30s voting (Host can extend 30s, ends when all vote).\n• Can self-vote or skip; results show votes for each player.\n\n[Task Mechanics]\n• Personal Task: Success +2% progress, failure adds nothing; costs 10s oxygen each time.\n• Shared Task: Starts when all players at location tap; success adds +3% progress per person; failure adds no progress but deducts oxygen.\n• Types: Nine-Grid Treasure Hunt, Digit Puzzle (10s limit).\n\n[Emergency Tasks] (Random 5-50s during red light)\n• Oxygen Leak: Oxygen drain becomes -3/sec; fixed if any player gives you oxygen; no extra oxygen cost.\n• Golden Rabbit: Join hunt team within 8s; nine-grid capture, success if anyone selects it; reward +8% progress.\n\n[Location Effects] (Active when alone)\n1. Kitchen (Oxygen Supply): Self oxygen +90s.\n2. Medical Bay (Remote Healing): Give any other player +90s oxygen.\n3. Power Room (Power Boost): +3% personal task progress this round.\n4. Monitor Room (View Footage): Peek at a random different-faction player's life code (shows for 5s).\n5. Warehouse (Emergency O₂): +60s oxygen for all players.\n6. Dispatch Room (Random Dispatch): Next yellow light assignments are randomized (ignores green light selection), 1-3 people per location.\n7. Stasis Pod (Absolute Dormancy): Enter dormancy, no oxygen cost, immune to all effects (cannot be killed/monitored/replenished/drained/haunted).\n\n[Ghost Haunting]\nWhen a player dies and their body is found triggering a meeting, they enter \"Ghost\" state. Ghosts don't physically move but act via App from the rest area.\n- 🟢 Green Light: Select a location (or choose \"Skip/Don't Haunt\").\n- 🟡 Yellow Light: Ghost appears at selected location; if skipped, appears nowhere.\n- 🔴 Red Light: Ghost sees live players and other ghosts at location, and can choose 1 live player to [Haunt].\n  - Effect: Target loses extra 3s oxygen every 10s, starts immediately.\n  - Stacking: Multiple ghosts can haunt the same target; cap is 9s extra drain per 10s (max 3 ghosts)."
