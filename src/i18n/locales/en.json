To prevent infiltration and sabotage, the ship uses the \"Traffic Light Protocol\": green light for free movement and communication, yellow light for mandatory distribution to work stations, red light for full ship lockdown—all engineers must complete tasks in place.\n\nBut imposters have infiltrated: the Duck clan. They look identical to Geese but aim to eliminate Geese and sabotage the project. Worse, the ship's life support uses dynamic \"Life Codes\": each member has a dynamic oxygen verification code that can be shared for oxygen replenishment; but Ducks only need to see and enter a code during lockdown to instantly disconnect someone's life support, creating silent \"accidents.\"\n\nWhen alarms sound, crew members can only hold emergency meetings and vote suspects into space. Engineering progress, oxygen levels, teammates' eyes and phone screen reflections will all be evidence for judging the truth—on this unfinished interstellar ark, survival and completion must happen together.\n\n[Victory Conditions]\n• Goose: 100% task progress or vote out all Ducks.\n• Duck: Kill all Geese, or Ducks ≥ non-Ducks.\n• Dodo (Neutral): Win by being voted out.\n• Hawk (Neutral): Can kill anyone, survive to the end (only you or you + 1 Goose left).\n\n[Round Rhythm]\n• 90 seconds per round: Green 15s location selection → Yellow 15s movement → Red 60s tasks/kills.\n• Life codes refresh approximately every 70 seconds.\n\n[Life Code & Oxygen]\n• Red light shows 2-digit life code for kills/oxygen.\n• 10 second cooldown after entering life code.\n• Oxygen: +90s each time; once per player per round.\n• Initial oxygen 270s per person; Ducks and Hawks get 180s backup oxygen when depleted (once per game).\n• Geese attempting to kill results in foul death.\n• Invalid kill codes cost 30s oxygen.\n\n[Meeting & Voting]\n• 60s discussion (host can skip or extend 30s).\n• 30s voting (host can extend 30s, ends when all vote).\n• Can vote self or skip; results show each player's votes.\n\n[Task Mechanics]\n• Personal Task: +2% progress on success, nothing on fail; costs 10s oxygen.\n• Shared Task: Starts when all at location join; +3% progress each on success; fail costs oxygen but no progress.\n• Types: Nine-Grid Treasure Hunt, Digit Puzzle (10s limit).\n\n[Emergency Tasks] (Random 5-50s during red light)\n• Oxygen Leak: Drain becomes -3/sec; any player giving you oxygen repairs it.\n• Golden Rabbit: 8s to join hunt team; nine-grid capture, anyone finding it wins; +8% progress reward.\n\n[Location Effects] (When alone)\n• Monitor Room (View Footage): Peek random opposing team player's life code (5s).\n• Power Room (Power Boost): Personal task +3% this round.\n• Kitchen (Oxygen Supply): Self +90s oxygen.\n• Medical Bay (Remote Healing): Give any other player +90s oxygen.\n• Warehouse (Emergency O₂): All players +60s oxygen."
